                <h3>About ARC</h3>
                <p class='info1-inv'>Automotive Research Centre, or ARC, is an offshoot of the School of Mechanical Engineering that was established in 2004 under the Fund for Improvement of Science and Technology Infrastructure (FIST) with a funding of Rs 5,600,000 from the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India. The center was supported by the School of Mechanical Engineering until 2016, after which it was separated from the school to strengthen the infrastructure and research that relate to the future direction of the global automotive industry. More recently, VIT has invested Rs 5 crore towards the centre’s resources to assist the development of state-of-the-art technology in autonomous vehicles. State University of New York, Binghamton has also collaborated with ARC in VIT to promote the research further.
                  Over the years, the centre has evolved into a place for the next generation of researchers and developers to nurture their ideas and polish their skills. It is providing a platform for them to publish their ideas and bring them to life so as to spread awareness about this technology among the masses and make an impact in the real world.</p>
